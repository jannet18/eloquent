ASYNCHRONOUS, TASK QUEUE AND EVENT LOOP
An asynchronous model allows multiple things to happen at the same time.
when you start an action your program continues to run. When the action is complete the program is informed and gets access to the result.

Blocking vs Non-Blocking
Blocking - operations that block further execution until the operation completes
Non-blocking - code that does not block execution

ORDER
Event loop
- contiounous process that runs in the background of a js runtime, such as web browser or Node.js
- constantly checks call stack for functions that need to be executed.

Call stack
- data structure that keeps tracks of function call in the order which they are invoked.
- when a function is called it is pushed n to the call stack and when it returns/completes it is popped off from the stack.

Task queue
- holds the tasks or callbacks that are ready to be executed.
- processed by the event loop when the call stackk is empty.
Execution order.

- correllation - is the measure of dependence between statistical values
