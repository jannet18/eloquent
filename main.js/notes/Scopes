Global SCOPE


RECURSION
Technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
It is powerful and eleganat way to solve  problems that can be broken down in to smaller ,similar subproblems.
Key points in RECURSION
1. Define a base case 
every recursive function should have a base case that defines when recursion should stop.
2. Make progress towards the base case.
each recursive call should move closer towards the base case.
3. Ensure termination
ensure the recursive function eventually reaches the base case.
4. Stack limitations
deep recursion can lead to "Maximum call stack size exceeded"
